This directory contains files which would demonstrate MLOps with tools developed/provided by Roboflow. 
You can try each of these examples with an Anki Vector robot. To run these examples, you would need:

1) The Vector Python SDK. You would need the SDK in the PYTHONPATH.
2) A Roboflow Key which you can get for free at roboflow.com

Here are some examples of programs you could run

1) python3 examinePicture.py --serial <Robot serial number>

This will open the robot's camera, take images, and run inference on the image, hopefully detecting some objects depending on the model used. 
You can specify the Machine Learning model from Roboflow Universe in utils.py. Simply modify the folowing two lines:

_DATASET_NAME = "rock-paper-scissors-sxsw"
_MODEL_UUID = "14"
